# Technical Service Call Management System
Technical Service Call Management System
This project is created using Java 8 and MySQL database. 
It's basically about managing technical services carried out by technicians. Technicians have to enter every call attended to. On service completion
they can create a mileage claim for their travel costs. 

Clients and assigned technicians get email notifications when a new service call is opened.
Clients and tehcnicians are updated when the service is completed, and a service report sent to the client via email.
